# Numerai Example Notebooks

Welcome to the [Numerai](https://numer.ai/) data science tournament! 

If you are just getting started, then these notebooks are for you.

In this notebook we will go through the basics of the tournament
1. Dataset: how to download the dataset and understand its basic structure
2. Modeling: how to train our first model 
3. Submissions: how to upload our model to make live submissions

## Model Diagnostics

In this notebook we will learn how to evaluate and diagnose model performance
1. Validation: how to evaluate model performance
2. Performance: computing Correlation, Sharpe, and Max Drawdown 
3. Risk: understanding Feature Exposure and Neutralization 


## Advanced Concepts

In this notebook we will dive deep into some of the advanced concepts
1. Targets: auxiliary targets, 20d vs 60d targets
2. Eras: overlapping eras, leakage and embargos
2. Ensembling: how to use it to improve performance
